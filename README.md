What is Odyssian Void?

Odyssian Void is an ambitious 4X project being developed by Laughing Man ProductionsÂ².  It aims to simulate a thriving and well formed universe within which players will undertake a mission of revenge and redemption or carve their own path through history.  It will be completely open, similar to Skyrim, where the main mission line can or does not have to be completed.

There will be a multi-genre system where by the player will be placed into different gameplay scenarios such as dog fighting, Eve-Online style space combat, RTS styled gameplay, FPS styled gameplay and others.  What systems are used will depend on player settings and some guesstimation around computer power.  The end result is expected to be a system which balances preformance against logical shifts from system to system).
